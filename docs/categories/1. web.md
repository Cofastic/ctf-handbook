# Web Exploitation

Web Exploitation involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. In CTF competitions, web challenges test your ability to find and exploit security weaknesses in websites, APIs, and web servers.

## Core Concepts

### üîπ Client-Side vs. Server-Side
Understanding the difference between vulnerabilities in the browser (client-side) and on the web server (server-side).

### üîπ HTTP Protocol
Knowledge of HTTP methods, headers, cookies, and status codes.

### üîπ Web Technologies
Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend languages (PHP, Python, etc.), and database systems.

### üîπ Same-Origin Policy
Understanding browser security mechanisms and how they can be bypassed.

### üîπ Authentication & Authorization
Differentiating between "who you are" and "what you're allowed to do."

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Injection Attacks
- **SQL Injection**: Manipulating database queries
  ```sql
  ' OR 1=1 --
  ```
- **Command Injection**: Executing system commands
  ```bash
  ; cat /etc/passwd
  ```
- **Server-Side Template Injection**: Exploiting template engines
  ```
  {{7*7}}
  ```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injecting malicious JavaScript code:

- **Reflected XSS**: Input is immediately reflected back
  ```html
  <script>alert(1)</script>
  ```
- **Stored XSS**: Malicious code is stored on the server
- **DOM-based XSS**: Exploitation occurs in client-side JavaScript

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Tricking users into performing unwanted actions on sites where they're authenticated.

### Insecure Deserialization
Exploiting insecure deserialization of user-controlled data.

### Server Misconfigurations
- Directory traversal
- Default credentials
- Sensitive file exposure

### Authentication Flaws
- Weak password policies
- Session fixation
- Insecure cookie settings

## Essential Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Installation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Burp Suite** | Web proxy for intercepting and modifying requests | Community Edition free download |
| **OWASP ZAP** | Open-source web security scanner | `sudo apt install zaproxy` |
| **Gobuster** | Directory and file brute forcing | `sudo apt install gobuster` |
| **SQLmap** | Automated SQL injection tool | `sudo apt install sqlmap` |
| **Nikto** | Web server scanner | `sudo apt install nikto` |
| **Curl** | Command-line tool for HTTP requests | `sudo apt install curl` |
| **Wappalyzer** | Browser extension to identify web technologies | Browser extension stores |
| **JWT_Tool** | JSON Web Token analysis and exploitation | `pip install jwt_tool` |
| **Chrome/Firefox DevTools** | Browser built-in development tools | Built into browsers |
| **Postman** | API testing and development | Free download |

## Try a Simple Challenge!

<details>
<summary>**üåê Login Bypass**</summary>

**Challenge**: A login form is vulnerable to SQL injection. Try to bypass it without knowing the credentials.

```html
<form action="login.php" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
  <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Think about how the login query might be structured in SQL.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Try using a single quote to break the SQL syntax, then comment out the rest of the query.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. The login form likely uses SQL like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'
```

2. Enter this payload in the username field:
```
admin' --
```

3. This transforms the query to:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' -- ' AND password='anything'
```

4. The `--` comments out the rest of the query, so the password check is bypassed.

5. Flag: `flag{sql_injection_bypass}`
</details>
</details>

## Advanced Techniques

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Forcing a server to make requests to internal resources.

### XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
Exploiting XML parsers to access local files or perform server-side requests.

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target server.

### GraphQL Vulnerabilities
Exploiting weaknesses in GraphQL implementations.

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass
Techniques to bypass browser security mechanisms.

### JWT Attacks
Exploiting vulnerabilities in JSON Web Tokens:
- Algorithm confusion
- Weak secrets
- Missing validation

## Methodology for Web Challenges

1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Check page source
   - Inspect network requests
   - Identify technologies used
   - Look for hidden directories and files

2. **Vulnerability Discovery**:
   - Test form inputs
   - Check for client-side validation
   - Look for common vulnerabilities
   - Analyze cookies and session handling

3. **Exploitation**:
   - Develop a proof-of-concept
   - Refine your exploit
   - Extract the flag

## Tips for Success

1. **Browser DevTools are Essential**: Learn to use the Network, Console, and Elements tabs effectively
2. **Proxies Provide Visibility**: Always use a proxy like Burp Suite to see everything
3. **Automate Wisely**: Know when to use automated tools versus manual testing
4. **Source Code Review**: Always check for comments and hidden functionality
5. **Keep Learning**: Web technologies evolve rapidly; stay up-to-date

Remember: Web exploitation often requires creative thinking and a deep understanding of how web technologies interact!
