# Cryptography


Cryptography involves securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format that can only be decoded by authorized parties. In CTF competitions, cryptography challenges test your ability to decrypt messages, break encryption schemes, and understand cryptographic algorithms and their vulnerabilities.

## Core Concepts

### üîπ Encryption & Decryption
The process of encoding and decoding information.

### üîπ Ciphers & Algorithms
Methods and procedures for encrypting and decrypting data.

### üîπ Keys
Secret pieces of information required to encrypt or decrypt data.

### üîπ Cryptanalysis
The study of breaking encryption systems.

### üîπ Hashing
One-way functions that convert data into fixed-length values.

## Common Cryptographic Categories

### Classical Ciphers
Early encryption methods that manipulate letters and characters:

- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts letters by a fixed number
  ```
  Plaintext:  HELLO
  Shift by 3:  KHOOR
  ```

- **Substitution Cipher**: Replaces each letter with another
  ```
  A -> X, B -> Y, C -> Z, etc.
  ```

- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: Uses a keyword to determine multiple shifts
  ```
  Plaintext:   HELLO
  Key:         KEYKE
  Ciphertext:  RIJVS
  ```

- **Transposition Cipher**: Rearranges the order of characters

### Modern Encryption

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption (AES, DES)

- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Different keys for encryption and decryption (RSA, ECC)

- **Hash Functions**: One-way functions that generate fixed-length outputs (MD5, SHA, bcrypt)

### Encoding (Not Encryption)

- **Base64**: Encodes binary data using 64 ASCII characters
  ```
  Hello ‚Üí SGVsbG8=
  ```

- **Hex**: Represents data using 16 digits (0-9, A-F)
  ```
  Hello ‚Üí 48656C6C6F
  ```

- **ASCII/Unicode**: Character representation standards

## Try a Simple Challenge!

<details>
<summary>**üîê Multi-Layer Encryption**</summary>

**Challenge**: Decrypt the following message to find the flag:
```
Rqtbq{fgczgnjb_nx_kze_ozf_nx_kwt_gprjx}
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
This message uses a simple substitution method. Think about rotating letters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Try different shift values in a Caesar cipher.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. First, recognize this is a Caesar cipher (a rotation of the alphabet)

2. Try different rotation values:
   - ROT-1: `Splcp{ghdhfokc_oy_lae_pag_oy_lwu_hqsky}`
   - ROT-2: `Tqmdq{hieiglpd_pz_mbf_qbh_pz_mxv_irtz}`
   - ...
   - ROT-5: `Wtngt{klhljosg_sc_pei_tek_sc_pa}_luvc}`
   - ...
   - ROT-17: `Flag{secrecy_is_fun_but_is_also_hard}`

3. At ROT-17, we get a readable message that follows the flag format

4. The flag is: `flag{secrecy_is_fun_but_is_also_hard}`
</details>
</details>

## Classical Cryptography Techniques

### Frequency Analysis
Breaking substitution ciphers by analyzing letter frequencies.

```python
def frequency_analysis(ciphertext):
    frequency = {}
    for char in ciphertext.lower():
        if char.isalpha():
            frequency[char] = frequency.get(char, 0) + 1
    return sorted(frequency.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### Shift Ciphers (Caesar)
Decrypting by trying all possible shifts.

```python
def caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):
    result = ""
    for char in ciphertext:
        if char.isalpha():
            ascii_offset = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset - shift) % 26 + ascii_offset)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

### Polyalphabetic Ciphers (Vigen√®re)
Using letter frequencies and pattern recognition to determine key length and values.

## Modern Cryptography Challenges

### RSA Vulnerabilities
Common weaknesses in RSA implementations:
- Small prime factors
- Common modulus attack
- Low exponent attacks
- Padding oracle attacks

Example: Finding private key with known primes
```python
def calculate_private_key(p, q, e):
    n = p * q
    phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
    d = pow(e, -1, phi)  # Modular multiplicative inverse
    return d
```

### Hash Cracking
Methods to find plaintext from hashes:
- Dictionary attacks
- Rainbow tables
- Brute force
- Known hash databases

```bash
# Using John the Ripper for MD5 hash
echo "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" > hash.txt
john --format=raw-md5 hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Block Cipher Attacks
Exploiting weaknesses in block ciphers:
- ECB mode patterns
- Padding oracle attacks
- IV manipulation
- Side-channel analysis

## Advanced Cryptography Topics

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
Cryptosystems based on elliptic curves offering high security with smaller keys.

### Homomorphic Encryption
Performing calculations on encrypted data without decrypting.

### Quantum Cryptography
Understanding quantum-resistant algorithms and quantum key distribution.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.

## Methodology for Cryptography Challenges

1. **Identification**:
   - Determine what type of encryption/encoding is used
   - Look for patterns and characteristics

2. **Analysis**:
   - Gather information about the system
   - Identify potential weaknesses

3. **Tool Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate tools for the specific encryption
   - Understand the tool's capabilities and limitations

4. **Attack Execution**:
   - Apply appropriate techniques to break the encryption
   - Iterate and refine your approach
