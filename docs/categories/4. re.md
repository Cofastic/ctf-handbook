# Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering in CTF competitions involves analyzing compiled programs, understanding their functionality, and uncovering hidden features without access to the source code. This discipline tests your ability to "work backwards" from executable code to understand a program's logic and behavior.

## Core Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ Program Analysis
Understanding program flow, functions, loops, and conditional statements when only given the compiled code.

### ðŸ”¹ Assembly Language
Reading and understanding low-level assembly code for different architectures:
- x86/x86-64
- ARM
- MIPS
- Others

### ðŸ”¹ Program Execution Flow
Tracing how a program executes, including:
- Function calls
- Conditional branches
- Loops
- Exception handling

### ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Recognition
Identifying common algorithms and patterns in compiled code:
- Encryption algorithms
- Hashing functions
- Compression
- Custom validation routines

## Common Challenge Types

### Crackme Challenges
Programs that require you to discover a password, serial number, or specific input to receive the flag.

```c
// Example pseudocode from a decompiled crackme
bool check_flag(char* input) {
    if (strlen(input) != 20) return false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        if (input[i] ^ 0x37 != secret_array[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Anti-Reversing Techniques
Programs that use techniques to make analysis difficult:
- Code obfuscation
- Anti-debugging tricks
- Packed executables
- Virtual machine protection

### Flag Validation
Programs that check if your input matches a flag using complex algorithms.

### Protocol Analysis
Reverse engineering custom network protocols or file formats.

### Mobile Application
Analyzing Android APKs or iOS applications for hidden functionality.

<summary>**ðŸ§® Password Checker**</summary>

**Challenge**: The following program checks for a password. Can you figure out what it is?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char input[50];
    printf("Enter the password: ");
    scanf("%s", input);
    
    if (strlen(input) != 11) {
        printf("Wrong password!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    
    char expected[12] = {0};
    expected[0] = 'c';
    expected[1] = input[7] - 8;
    expected[2] = input[2] + 2;
    expected[3] = input[9] - 5;
    expected[4] = input[0] + 1;
    expected[5] = input[4] + 7;
    expected[6] = input[3] - 3;
    expected[7] = input[1] + 1;
    expected[8] = input[6] - 6;
    expected[9] = input[5] - 4;
    expected[10] = input[8] + 6;
    
    if (strcmp(expected, "cr4ckm3n0w!") == 0) {
        printf("Correct! Flag: flag{reverse_success}\n");
    } else {
        printf("Wrong password!\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The program creates an `expected` string based on transformations of your input, then compares it to "cr4ckm3n0w!".
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
You need to work backwards to determine what your input needs to be for each transformation to result in the correct character.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. We need to find an input that, when transformed according to the rules, produces "cr4ckm3n0w!".

2. Let's work backwards:
   - expected[0] = 'c' (no transformation)
   - expected[1] = input[7] - 8, so input[7] = 'r' + 8 = 'z'
   - expected[2] = input[2] + 2, so input[2] = '4' - 2 = '2'
   - expected[3] = input[9] - 5, so input[9] = 'c' + 5 = 'h'
   - expected[4] = input[0] + 1, so input[0] = 'k' - 1 = 'j'
   - expected[5] = input[4] + 7, so input[4] = 'm' - 7 = 'f'
   - expected[6] = input[3] - 3, so input[3] = '3' + 3 = '6'
   - expected[7] = input[1] + 1, so input[1] = 'n' - 1 = 'm'
   - expected[8] = input[6] - 6, so input[6] = '0' + 6 = '6'
   - expected[9] = input[5] - 4, so input[5] = 'w' + 4 = '\{'
   - expected[10] = input[8] + 6, so input[8] = '!' - 6 = '%'

3. The correct password is: `jm26f{6z%h`

4. When entered into the program, it will produce the flag: `flag{reverse_success}`
